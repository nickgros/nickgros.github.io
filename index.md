I'm currently an undergraduate student at [The Ohio State University](https://osu.edu/), in Columbus, Ohio, majoring in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.osu.edu/). This summer and fall, I will be a software engineering intern at [Sage Bionetworks](http://sagebionetworks.org).

I am particularly interested in leveraging computer science to improve healthcare and advance research in human disease. I am also a musician, playing trumpet in a few ensembles at OSU, trying to get better at guitar, and sometimes making really bad beats in Ableton.

I'm also casually interested in sports, hikes, politics, privacy, AI, and personal finance, among other topics.

I may use this space to write or share things in the future.
